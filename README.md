CosmicQuest: Gravitational Lens Detection Using Deep Learning

Project Overview

CosmicQuest is a deep learning pipeline developed to detect strong gravitational lensing phenomena from large astronomical survey datasets, including DESI, SDSS, and KiDS. This project blends astrophysics and AI to address key cosmological challenges like dark matter distribution and Einstein ring identification.

Awarded Best Research Project by the Science and Technology Council (SnT), IIT Kanpur, this work showcases the power of combining domain knowledge in cosmology with modern neural networks for cutting-edge space research.
